#CS393-Final-Project---MuQuery
Simple Collaborative Playlist Creator Made with PHP &amp; jQuery

##Description

MuQuery was my final project I made for the course CS 393 - Computer Networks.
It is designed to allow the collaborative creation of music playlists using both songs from SoundCloud and Youtube.

##Usage
On a desktop computer, one user must connect to the site, wherever it may be hosted, and create a new room.
To add songs to the room's playlist, users should connect with a mobile device. The site will automatically redirect
them to the mobile site. There they enter the server's room number and join the session. 
Once connected, search for the songs you want to add and they will be queued for playback.
